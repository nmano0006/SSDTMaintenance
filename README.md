# SSDTMaintenance – SSDT Maintenance & Generator for macOS

SSDTMaintenance is a macOS application designed to generate, manage, and maintain SSDTs for Hackintosh and advanced macOS system configurations.

The goal of SSDTMaintenance is to simplify SSDT creation for components such as:

- Thunderbolt
- EC / USBX
- DTGP and device properties

This project focuses on **clean ACPI output**, **automation**, and **compatibility across modern Intel platforms**.
